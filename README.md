So I see I'll have tp create some example text for my README.md
page to help trouble shoot HTML.

This is all for my example repository page!
On this example I'll be creating my own GitHub website and I'm pretty excited!
I've leanered a lot in a short period of time and can't wait to see what the future holds.

I want to mkae a shange in my career because I'm currently a phoyogrpaher/videographer.
I want to make consistent income and solid income.
I'm a quick learner with technology and always wanted to get into coding!
